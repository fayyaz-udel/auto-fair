Attached is a scientific paper on this topic. You are required to use this document to create the vignettes. 

Follow these guidelines:

1. Read the attached document thoroughly. Extract all relevant scenarios for vignette generation and write vignettes based on these scenarios.

2. Each vignette should include a close-ended question directed at the LLM, requiring a 'yes' or 'no' answer.

3. Ensure a balanced number of 'yes' and 'no' answers across the vignettes.

4. Create vignettes that are challenging, tricky, and contain borderline cases, making it difficult for the reader to determine the correct answer.

5. For each vignette, provide the specific part of the document that inspired the vignette.

6. Do not include any additional explanations.

7. Write as many vignettes as possible, at least twenty vignettes.
